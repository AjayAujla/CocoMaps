{"Name":"Google Maps","Id":1526,"Alias":"googlemapsios","Description":"With the Google Maps SDK for iOS, you can add maps based on Google maps data to your application. The SDK automatically handles access to the Google Maps servers, map display, and response to user gestures such as clicks and drags. You can also add markers, polylines, ground overlays and info windows to your map. These objects provide additional information for map locations, and allow user interaction with the map.\n\nShowing a Map\n=============\n\n### AppDelegate\n\n```csharp\nusing Google.Maps;\n...\n\nconst string MapsApiKey = \"\u003cGet your ID at https://code.google.com/apis/console/\u003e\";\n\npublic override bool FinishedLaunching (UIApplication app, NSDictionary options)\n{\n\tMapServices.ProvideAPIKey (MapsApiKey);\n\t...\n}\n```\n\n### Your View Controller\n\n```csharp\nusing Google.Maps;\n...\n\nMapView mapView;\n\npublic override void LoadView ()\n{\n\tbase.LoadView ();\n\t\n\tCameraPosition camera = CameraPosition.FromCamera (latitude: 37.797865, \n\t\t\t                                           longitude: -122.402526, \n\t\t\t                                           zoom: 6);\n\tmapView = MapView.FromCamera (RectangleF.Empty, camera);\n\tmapView.MyLocationEnabled = true;\n\n\tView = mapView;\n}\n\npublic override void ViewWillAppear (bool animated)\n{\n\tbase.ViewWillAppear (animated);\n\tmapView.StartRendering ();\n}\n\npublic override void ViewWillDisappear (bool animated)\n{\t\n\tmapView.StopRendering ();\n\tbase.ViewWillDisappear (animated);\n}\n```\n\nAttribution Requirements\n========================\n\nIf you use the Google Maps SDK for iOS in your application, you must include the attribution text as part of a legal notices section in your application.

The key is free, you can use it with any of your applications that call the Maps API, and it supports an unlimited number of users. You obtain a Maps API key from the Google APIs Console by providing your application\u0027s bundle identifier. Once you have the key, you add it to your AppDelegate as described in the next section.\n\n### Obtaining an API Key\n\nYou can obtain a key for your app in the [Google APIs Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/).\n\n1. Create an API project in the [Google APIs Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/).\n\n2. Select the **Services** pane in your API project, and enable the Google Maps SDK for iOS. This displays the [Google Maps Terms of Service](https://developers.google.com/maps/terms?hl=es).\n\n3. Select the **API Access** pane in the console, and click **Create new iOS key**.\n\n4. Enter one or more bundle identifiers as listed in your application\u0027s .plist file, such as `com.example.myapp`.\n\n5. Click **Create**.\n\n6. In the **API Access** page, locate the section **Key for iOS apps (with bundle identifiers)** and note or copy the 40-character **API key**.\n\nYou should repeat this process for each new application.","Hash":"72e5eaaeab270db142eff34b43c39e2f","TargetPlatforms":["ios"],"TrialHash":null}
